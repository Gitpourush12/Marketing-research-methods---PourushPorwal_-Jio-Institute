Whatever i purchased Mr. Tata&#39;s clothing brand like zudio and westside thus awesome quality and affordable prices according to the customer needs. Having failed with reliance trands in indian market then  Ambani must have thought to try something else toake profit in this sector then approached this chinese clothing makers. This man does not have enough idea and proper planning to make own identity of brands in india and across globe instead of taking chinese partnership or licensing?? Again thickheadedness!!\n",

Now you know why the Chinese were not going away from Doklam and what we really need to do start fixing India&#39;s border and security issues. India really needs a strong party with strong nationalistic and Hindutva credentials to lead it. Cheap is expensive and expensive(quality not price) is cheap.

That&#39;s the reason behind bringing a Chinese brand which in fact a fast fashion Giant to India.  This will definitely destroy nit only the other brands but also the market and the sustainability.\n",

Whatever i purchased Mr. Tata&#39;s clothing brand like zudio and westside thus awesome quality and affordable prices according to the customer needs. Having failed with reliance trands in indian market then  Ambani must have thought to try something else toake profit in this sector then approached this chinese clothing makers. This man does not have enough idea and proper planning to make own identity of brands in india and across globe instead of taking chinese partnership or licensing?? Again thickheadedness!!\n",

India really needs a strong party with strong nationalistic and Hindutva credentials to lead it. Cheap is expensive and expensive(quality not price) is cheap.

            "Comment: I&#39;m grateful to Mukesh Ambani for forcing all telecom operators to give cheap internet but I&#39;ll never buy from Shein. I&#39;d rather support Zudio. Reliance should have come up with an Indian alternative if their goal was to compete with Zudio.<br>They hold enough influence and power to revive Indian Handlooms by making them mainstream. Yet, they chose to bring back this trashy brand that was banned in the name of nationalism. What a let down. Expected better from the Ambanis, especially after seeing the incredible work they&#39;re doing in Vantara.\n",

Zudio is only worth for few time use. Wash it few times and the cloth degrades like our rupee degraded.\n",

I don’t understand why Mukesh Ambani is doing business with this cheapest things and Ganesh can we talk about how Jio’s plans are super monopoly like I don’t have another choice but to stick to Jio while their plans suck for any middle class user. Their plans are not viable anymore . Jio is becoming scary every day. I guess the marriage of Ambani is the end of its goodness. We shouldn’t encourage such family business at all.\n",

That&#39;s the reason behind bringing a Chinese brand which in fact a fast fashion Giant to India.

            "Comment: We Indian citizens are trying to avoid Chinese products and these multinational companies and billionaires just to earn more profits, are willing to sell Chinese products to us just by rebranding the company and sprinkling little nationalism, just to earn more profits.<br>Even more, the second order effects of cheap Chinese products getting into India will eventually drive out Indian cloth companies because they won&#39;t be able to even touch the Chinese prices. And thus Reliance again becomes a monopoly in clothes sector also, just like in telecom. <br>Sadly the loop goes on and on.<br>The only ones suffering will be Indian businesses initially and then the consumers  once it becomes a monopoly.\n",
